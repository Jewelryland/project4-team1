In this project, we used the [Stanford dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html) consisting of Amazon movie from Aug 1997 to Oct 2012 to build a movie recommendation system. We filtered the dataset to a smaller one by choosing users with more than 100 reviews and movies that has more than 100 reviews.

The recommendation system is users-based and it recommends the user three movies based on the movies feed to the system and their ratings entered. 

When new user enters the movie names and the corresponding ratings the recommender will look for the most similar users in the existing dataset by cosine similarity. This could be a collection of more than one similar existing users. If this is the case, the system will pick the top three movies from all the movies rated by this group of similar users. During the process, we used Amazon API to transform movie name to ASIN. At last, three movies together with their posters will be returned by the system that are thought to suit the userâ€™s taste well. A hyperlink is given for each movie and can redirect to the amazon page of the movie. The web app is based on flask and deployed to heroku.

Our movie recommendation web app can be found [here](https://vast-basin-99316.herokuapp.com/). We recommend to use Chrome. After you click recommend, please wait for about 15s for fetching data from amazon. If the web does'nt respond, you can refresh the webpage (F5) to see the results. The reason is that heroku has a limited time of web response for free server and our request for fetching data takes longer than that limit, while we cannot control the time for scraping data from amazon. However, after timeout, we can still fetch the data and update out database. Therefore you can view the recommendation results by refreshing the page, which re-read the updated database. Please also note that the app on heroku free server can be only activate up to 18 hours every 24 hours. If you find the app doesn't work, please find another time to play with it. We are still trying to solve this problem. 

The app runs perfectly in a local folder. Everyone is welcome to use our repository to build a web app of their own. You can download the "app" folder to your computer and run app.py in terminal. We used python 2.7, python flask, python amazonapi, html, javascipt and jquery for building the app. The solutions to some problems in building the app can be found on our [wiki page](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/project4-team1/wiki).
